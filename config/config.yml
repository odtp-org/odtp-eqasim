## Synthetic population pipeline for ÃŽle-de-France
## based on the synpp package

# This is the path to a directory where the pipeline can store temporary data
working_directory: /app/cache

# This section defines which parts of the pipeline should be run
run:
  - synthesis.output # To create the output population in the output_path (see below)
  #- matsim.output # Uncomment, if you want to run the full simulation (you'll need Java for that)

# Here the configuraiton of the pipeline starts
config:
  # Some general configuration

  # Define sampling rate and random seed for the output population
